## **Introduction**

The **AI-Powered Resume Screening and Ranking System** is designed to streamline the recruitment process by automating the initial screening of resumes. The system uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques, such as **TF-IDF** and **cosine similarity**, to analyze and rank resumes based on their relevance to a given job description. This helps recruiters save time, reduce bias, and focus on the most suitable candidates.

## **Performance Metrics**

The system is evaluated using the following metrics:

| **Metric**               | **Description**                                                                 | **Formula**                                                                 | **Expected Value** |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| **Accuracy**             | Measures the percentage of correctly ranked resumes compared to manual ranking.  | \( \text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{Number of Correct Rankings}}{\text{Total Rankings}} \times 100 \) | 85% - 95%         |
| **Precision**            | Measures the proportion of relevant resumes among the top-ranked resumes.        | \( \text{Precision} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives} + \text{False Positives}} \) | 80% - 90%         |
| **Recall**               | Measures the proportion of relevant resumes that were correctly ranked.          | \( \text{Recall} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives} + \text{False Negatives}} \) | 75% - 85%         |
| **F1-Score**             | Combines precision and recall into a single metric using the harmonic mean.      | \( \text{F1-Score} = 2 \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}} \) | 80% - 90%         |
| **Cosine Similarity**    | Measures the similarity between the job description and resumes.                 | \( \text{Cosine Similarity} = \frac{\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B}}{\|\mathbf{A}\| \|\mathbf{B}\|} \) | 0.7 - 1.0         |
| **Response Time**        | Measures the time taken to process and rank resumes.                            | \( O(n \times m) \) (where \( n \) = number of resumes, \( m \) = number of terms) | < 1 second/resume |
| **Scalability**          | Measures the system's ability to handle large volumes of resumes.                | -                                                                           | Supports up to 10,000 resumes |

### **Explanation of Metrics**

1. **Accuracy**:
   - This metric evaluates how often the system correctly ranks resumes compared to manual ranking by recruiters.
   - A high accuracy (85% - 95%) indicates that the system is reliable and effective.

2. **Precision**:
   - This metric measures the proportion of relevant resumes among the top-ranked resumes.
   - A high precision (80% - 90%) indicates that the system is good at identifying the most relevant candidates.

3. **Recall**:
   - This metric measures the proportion of relevant resumes that were correctly ranked.
   - A high recall (75% - 85%) indicates that the system is good at capturing all relevant candidates.

4. **F1-Score**:
   - This metric combines precision and recall into a single score using the harmonic mean.
   - A high F1-score (80% - 90%) indicates a good balance between precision and recall.

5. **Cosine Similarity**:
   - This metric measures the similarity between the job description and resumes.
   - A high cosine similarity score (0.7 - 1.0) indicates a strong match between the job description and the resume.

6. **Response Time**:
   - This metric measures the time taken to process and rank resumes.
   - The system should process each resume in less than 1 second for optimal performance.

7. **Scalability**:
   - This metric measures the system's ability to handle large volumes of resumes.
   - The system should support up to 10,000 resumes without significant performance degradation.
